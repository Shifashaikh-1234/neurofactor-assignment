# 🌿 ChutNee - React.js Web Application

## 📋 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Software Developer Internship Technical Task** for **Neurofactor Technologies Private Limited**.

The goal of this task was to **build, animate, and deploy** a fully functional, **mobile-responsive web application** that accurately translates the **ChutNee Figma Design** using **React.js**, with a strong focus on **performance optimization, clean code, and smooth CSS animations**.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Vite for fast development and builds)
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **React Hooks**
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-first)**
- **CSS Animations (Transitions & Keyframes)**
- **Deployed on Vercel**

---

## 🎨 Design Implementation

The application layout, color palette, typography, and component structure were built to closely **match the Figma design**.  
All design details were followed precisely to maintain high fidelity with the original reference.

---

## ✨ Features & Highlights

- 🔹 **Pixel-perfect implementation** of the Figma design  
- 🔹 **Pure CSS animations** (hover effects, smooth load transitions, state-based motion)  
- 🔹 **Highly optimized performance** — lightweight, fast-loading, and responsive  
- 🔹 **Fully mobile-friendly layout** that adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes  
- 🔹 **Clean and modular React component structure**  
- 🔹 **Reusable UI components** for maintainability

## 📱 Responsiveness

The app is designed with a **mobile-first approach**, ensuring smooth usability across:
- Smartphones (portrait & landscape)
- Desktop and large screens

Media queries and flexible units (`rem`, `%`, `vw/vh`, `fr`) are used throughout the layout for adaptive design.

---

## ⚙️ Performance & Animation

- All animations implemented using **pure CSS transitions and keyframes** — **no external animation libraries** used.
- CSS animations are GPU-accelerated and optimized to prevent layout shifts or jank.
- Lazy loading and efficient React rendering patterns ensure a fast, responsive UX.
